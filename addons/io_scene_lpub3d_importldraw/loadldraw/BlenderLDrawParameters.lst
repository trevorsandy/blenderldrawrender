# This config file captures parameters for the Blender LDraw Render addon
# Parameters must be prefixed using one of the following predefined
# 'Item' labels:
# - lgeo_colour
# - sloped_brick
# - light_brick

# All items must use a comma',' delimiter as the primary delimiter.
# For sloped_brick items, a pipe'|' delimiter must be used to specify
# a range (min|max) within which the angle must lie when appropriate.
# Spaces between item attributes are not required and are used to
# facilitate human readability.


# LGEO CUSTOM COLOURS
# LGEO is a parts library for rendering LEGO using the POV-Ray
# rendering software. This is the list of LEGO colours suitable
# for realistic rendering extracted from the LGEO file 'lg_color.inc'.
# When the 'Colour Scheme' option is set to 'Realistic', the standard
# LDraw colours RGB value is overwritten with the values defined here.
# Note: You can customize these RGB values as you want.
